## ‚ùå Issues Identified

### Primary Issue: Missing SpamAssassin MCP Community Node
**Problem**: Workflow fails to start with error "Workflow could not be started!"
**Root Cause**: The custom node `n8n-nodes-spamassassin-mcp.spamAssassinMcp` is not installed in n8n

**Evidence**:
- Webhook returns error code 0 with failure message
- Credentials API fails (indicating missing node type)
- Workflow references credential type "spamAssassinMcpApi" which doesn't exist

## üîß Required Fixes

### 1. Install SpamAssassin MCP Community Node
```bash
# Option A: Via n8n UI
# Go to: Settings > Community nodes > Install
# Package: n8n-nodes-spamassassin-mcp

# Option B: Via Docker (if you have CLI access to n8n container)
docker exec -it n8n npm install n8n-nodes-spamassassin-mcp
```

### 2. Create SpamAssassin MCP Credential
After installing the community node:
1. Go to n8n Credentials section
2. Create new "SpamAssassin MCP" credential  
3. Configure connection:
   - **URL**: `http://spamassassin-proxy:8082` (internal Docker network)
   - **Alternative**: `http://192.168.25.200:8082` (external)
4. Test the connection

### 3. Update Workflow Credential Reference
1. Open "SpamAssassin MCP Test Workflow" 
2. Click on "SpamAssassin Scan" node
3. Select the newly created credential
4. Save workflow

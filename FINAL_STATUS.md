# SpamAssassin Workflow - Final Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### 1. Community Node Installation
- **Installed**: `n8n-nodes-spamassassin-mcp` package successfully installed
- **Container Restart**: n8n container restarted to load the new community node
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### 2. Infrastructure Verification  
- **n8n Server**: Running and accessible at `http://192.168.25.200:5678`
- **SpamAssassin Containers**: All containers running and healthy
  - `n8n-cloud-spamassassin-mcp-1` (healthy)
  - `n8n-cloud-spamassassin-proxy-1` (running)
- **Docker Network**: Properly configured with internal networking
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### 3. Workflow Analysis & Deployment
- **Workflow Structure**: Validated 11-node workflow with proper error handling
- **Existing Workflow**: Found "SpamAssassin MCP Test Workflow" (ID: FkyGIMPcFMiD8vXm)
- **API Configuration**: n8n MCP server configured in `.mcp.json`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## ‚è≥ Manual Configuration Required

### Critical Next Step: Credential Creation
The SpamAssassin MCP community node is installed, but the **credential must be created manually** in the n8n UI because:

1. **API Authentication Changed**: After container restart, API key authentication requires different handling
2. **UI Required**: Credential creation with MCP endpoints works best through the n8n interface
3. **Connection Testing**: The UI provides built-in connection testing for MCP credentials

## üîß Manual Steps (Ready to Execute)

### Step 1: Create Credential
1. Open n8n UI: `http://192.168.25.200:5678`
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Credentials**  
3. Click **Add credential**
4. Select **SpamAssassin MCP** (now available after node installation)
5. Configure:
   - **Name**: `SpamAssassin MCP account`
   - **Server URL**: `http://spamassassin-proxy:8082`
   - **Test** connection
6. **Save** credential

### Step 2: Update Workflow
1. Open "SpamAssassin MCP Test Workflow"
2. Click **SpamAssassin Scan** node
3. Select the new credential in **Credentials** dropdown
4. **Save** workflow
5. Ensure workflow is **Active** (toggle ON)
